si no se le agrega un return a la funcion sale none, lo cual significa 
que esta vacio


Boolean Operators "and" and "or"
So far, you learned how to check for one single condition:

x = 1
 
if x == 1:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")


You can also check if two conditions are met at the same time using an and operator:

x = 1
y = 1
 
if x == 1 and y==1:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
That will return Yes since x == 1 and y ==1 are both True.



You can also check if one of two conditions are met using an or operator:

x = 1
y = 1
 
if x == 1 or y==2:
    print("Yes")
else:
    print("No")
That will return Yes since at least one of the conditions is True. In this case x == 1 is True.

More String Formatting
There is also another way to format strings using the "{}".format(variable) form. Here is an example:

name = "John"
surname = "Smith"
 
message = "Your name is {}. Your surname is {}".format(name, surname)
print(message)
Output: Your name is John. Your surname is Smith

Cheatsheet: Processing User Input
In this section, you learned that:

A Python program can get user input via the input function:

The input function halts the execution of the program and gets text input from the user:

name = input("Enter your name: ")


The input function converts any input to a string, but you can convert it back to int or float:

experience_months = input("Enter your experience in months: ")
experience_years = int(experience_months) / 12


You can also format strings with:

name = "Sim"
experience_years = 1.5
print("Hi {}, you have {} years of experience".format(name, experience_years))
Output: Hi Sim, you have 1.5 years of experience.
